# Contributorship Collaboration
The goal of the __Contributorship Collaboration__ project to make curating and reporting scholarly contributions easier and more transparent.

See our [list of projects](https://contributorshipcollaboration.github.io/projects/translation/)

One of our projects is the [tenzing](https://tenzing.club) Shiny app and assiciated R package that we developed to facilitate researcher reporting of contributorship information in manuscripts and journal articles.

tenzing is named after the Nepali-Indian Sherpa Tenzing Norgay, who was one of the two individuals who reached the summit of Mount Everest for the first time. Despite his essential contribution, the achievement is less credited to him than to his partner, the New Zealand mountaineer Edmund Hillary.
